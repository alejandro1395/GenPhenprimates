#Here I create the doc file for scripts on this project

1ST step -- Filter query species for establishing orthologies with non-redund sequences (Python/CD-HIT)

2nd step -- Create target database with non-redundant sequence for the whole set of species (Python/CD-HIT)

3rd step -- Make BlastDB for non-redundant set of proteins from CD-HIT SOFTWARE

4th step -- BLASTP allvsall looping for each reference species in our set (previous to FIND BBH, just searching homology)

5th Step -- Script to create fasta of CDS sequence from the reference species fasta and their annotations

6th Step -- Script to concatenate CDS sequences and translate them to protein fasta sequences (2 species by now more)
(Take care, for each gene (total of 18,875 for example for Tarsius), keep the longest CDS ) --> FILTRAR EN EL CDS_MERGE (me tienen que quedar alrededor de 19000-18000 prot)
--> La mejor opcion para filtrar
