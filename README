1ST step -- Filter query species for establishing orthologies with non-redund sequences (Python/CD-HIT)

2nd step -- Create target database with non-redundant sequence for the whole set of species (Python/CD-HIT)

3rd step -- Make BlastDB for non-redundant set of proteins from CD-HIT SOFTWARE

4th step -- BLASTP allvsall looping for each reference species in our set (previous to FIND BBH, just searching homology)
